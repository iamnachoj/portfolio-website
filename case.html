  <h1>Case Study for Bukness full-stack project</h1>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Bukness is a web app, developed using the MERN stack, that provides users with access to information about non-fictional books, 
        authors, and genres. Users are able to create an account, update their personal data, and create a list of favorite books.</p>
      <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
      <p>Bukness was a personal project I built as part of my web development course at CareerFoundry to demonstrate my mastery of 
        full-stack JavaScript development.</p>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>The aim of the project was to have an ambitious full-stack project I can add to my professional portfolio. The problem I wanted 
        to solve was to build the complete server-side and client-side for the application from scratch.</p>

      <h2>Server-Side</h2>
      <p>I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, that interacts with a non-relational database (MongoDB). The API can be 
        accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. To retrieve data from and store data in the database, CRUD methods 
        are used. The API provides book data in JSON format.</p>
      <p>I used Node.js and it's most popular framework, express, to create its different routes.</p><br>
      <p><a class="button" href="https://bukness-app.herokuapp.com/documentation">view API documentation</a></p><br>
      <p>To test the API, I used Postman. I also included user authentication and authorization code in the form of basic HTTP 
        authentication and JWT authentication.</p>
      <p>Passwords are hashed using Bcrypt, following the industry's best practice on security. </p>

      <h2>Client-Side</h2>
      <p>After completing the API, I started to build the interface users would need when making requests to, and receiving responses 
        from, the server-side. It is a single-page, responsive application, developed with <b> React and React-Redux.</b></p>
        <p>It provides several 
        interface views, including, but not limited to, a main view (shows a list of all books), single book view (shows data about
        a single book and allows users to add the book to their list of favorites), a login view, a registration view and a profile view 
        (where users can update their user data and list of favorites).</p>
        <p>Users can also update their profile, delete their account, and read about authors and book genres (as the API allows to)</p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>This was both my favorite and most challenging project. I have enjoyed building the API and working with database structures. 
        I also quickly became familiar with using the terminal. Developing the client-side, it took me a while to understand how React 
        and Redux work and how to achieve the desired results. But with the help of my great tutor and after a pair-programming session 
        with an experienced developer, I could conquer that mountain.</p>
      <h2>Duration</h2>
      <p>The development of the client-side took me twice as long as it normally took to complete a CareerFoundry achievement. This was 
        because I needed time to wrap my head around how React (and React Redux) work.</p>
      <p>Thanks to this program, I became much more familiar with how the architectural concept works and the structure of bigger projects
        is built. I also learnt a lot more about JavaScript and of course it's most famous library React.
