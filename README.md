# My Porfolio Website

## Profile

Personal, minimalistic Porfolio website built with pure HTML, CSS and Javascript code.

The idea behind is to be plain and simple, showing few projects and a description about oneself. 

## Features

- The site is full responsive and enabled in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.
- Makes use of all best-practice and most used UI patterns in the market. 
- Stays minimalistic, with the aim of focusing on the content

## Deployment

Check it out <a href="https://iamnachoj.github.io/portfolio-website/">here</a>! 

It is a static website and therefore has no use of anything more than vanilla JS and cannot keep any information stored in a db. 

- Clone repository
- alternate personal information to the porfolio with your own work and style
- post it to gh-pages or create your own domain.
